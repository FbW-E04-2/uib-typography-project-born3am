Spacing 

Give Your Elements Enough Room to Breath

One of the easiest ways to make your web pages look more professional
is to add bigger margins or padding between everything.

By everything, we mean the space between headings, paragraphs, images,
form controls, the vertical space between lines, the horizontal space
between the edge of the page, and pretty much every other margin or
padding you can think of.

Using a consistent margin between headings, paragraphs,
images, and other elements gives a vertical rhythm to the page. See

doesn’t fit in, and your web page is no longer a cohesive whole.
