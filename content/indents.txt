Paragraph Indents

Indents

Everything in typography is about being subtle, and styling the
separation between paragraphs is no different.

Denoting a new paragraph should hardly be noticable to the reader, and
first-line indents are a good way to achieve that. The first paragraph
doesn’t need to be indented.

Or Margins

Spacing is the other way to set off a new paragraph. You can do this
with the bottom-margin CSS property.

We find that using a bottom margin makes it a little easier to scan a
web page, while indents give more of a narrative or newspaper-y feel.

But Never Both

The purpose of a first-line indent or bottom margin is to indicate to
the reader that, well, you’re starting a new paragraph.

Readers aren’t stupid, and they don’t need two signs that a new
paragraph is happening. That’s redundant.
